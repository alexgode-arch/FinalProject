# Navigating the AI Regulation Patchwork: A Path Forward for American Innovation
Executive Summary
The United States faces a critical challenge in artificial intelligence governance. In 2024, state lawmakers introduced nearly 700 AI-related bills across 45 states, with 113 enacted into law—a dramatic increase from just 191 bills in 2023. This explosive growth in state-level AI regulation has created a fragmented compliance landscape that threatens American innovation and disproportionately harms small businesses. 65% of small businesses are concerned about rising litigation and compliance costs from conflicting AI laws. California's regulations alone will impose nearly $16,000 in annual compliance costs on small businesses. This policy brief recommends establishing a federal AI regulatory framework that preempts conflicting state regulations while preserving state authority to enforce consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws.

Background and Problem Statement
The absence of comprehensive federal AI legislation has created a vacuum that states have rushed to fill. In 2024, 46 states passed 238 new pieces of technology regulation, representing a 163% increase from the previous year. This regulatory explosion covers diverse AI applications including automated decision-making in employment and credit, algorithmic bias prevention, deepfakes, and data privacy requirements.
Colorado became the first state to pass comprehensive AI legislation with SB-205, effective June 2026. Other states including California, Connecticut, and Virginia have introduced their own distinct approaches, creating a patchwork of conflicting requirements.
Key Stakeholders include government agencies at state and federal levels, technology companies from major platforms to AI startups, small businesses using AI to scale operations, consumers and civil society organizations seeking protection from AI-related harms, and investors assessing regulatory uncertainty.
The Urgency: Research shows that Colorado's AI law alone could cost the state 40,000 jobs and $7 billion in economic output by 2030. When faced with regulations like those in Colorado and California, one-third of small business owners stated they would scale down AI use, and another fifth would avoid AI altogether. A startup facing a 200% increase in compliance costs could see its operating margin shift from profitable at 13% to a loss of -7%. Without standardized frameworks, companies cannot accurately budget for compliance, creating legal uncertainty that advantages large corporations while stifling startup innovation.

Policy Options and Recommendation
Option 1: Maintain Status Quo (State-Led Regulation)
Allow states to continue developing their own AI frameworks without federal intervention. While this enables local tailoring and policy experimentation, it creates unsustainable compliance chaos, disproportionately harms small businesses, reduces American competitiveness, and provides no consistent consumer protections across states.
Option 2: Comprehensive Federal Preemption
Enact a single federal AI law that preempts all state regulations and establishes uniform national standards. This eliminates compliance complexity and creates consistency, but may be politically infeasible, overly rigid for evolving technology, and could override beneficial state innovations.
Option 3: Federal Framework with State Enforcement Authority (RECOMMENDED)
Establish a federal AI regulatory framework focused on high-risk AI applications while preserving state authority to enforce existing consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws. This approach would create national standards for AI transparency and accountability, define "high-risk AI systems" consistently, preempt conflicting state AI-specific regulations, and allow states to enforce through traditional legal mechanisms.
Why This Option Is Best: This approach reduces compliance burden while respecting state interests in consumer protection. It follows successful federal frameworks in areas like securities regulation. The economic evidence is compelling: reducing conflicting AI laws will enable American businesses, particularly small businesses, to innovate without fear of inadvertent non-compliance. Consumers maintain strong protections through both federal standards and state enforcement. Most importantly, this bipartisan approach is politically achievable—89% of tech laws were enacted in states with trifecta governments, suggesting broad support for carefully crafted federal action.
Implementation would include risk-based standards for consequential decisions, mandatory transparency requirements, impact assessments, clear consumer opt-out mechanisms, safe harbor provisions, and technical assistance for small businesses.

Conclusion
The explosion of state AI regulation reflects genuine concerns about algorithmic discrimination and privacy. However, the current fragmented approach threatens American leadership in AI while failing to deliver consistent consumer protections. A federal framework that establishes clear standards while preserving state enforcement authority offers the best path forward. The cost of inaction is measured in billions of dollars of economic impact, lost opportunities, and diminished American competitiveness. Congress should act decisively in 2025 to establish this framework before the patchwork becomes irreversibly complex.
